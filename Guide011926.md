Got it! Let’s break this down step by step in Markdown so you can learn what pywebview is and how to run a Flask app inside it locally.

🚀 Using PyWebView with Flask
1. What is PyWebView?
PyWebView is a lightweight cross-platform library that lets you create GUI desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

It works by embedding a native webview window (like a browser window without the browser UI) into a Python application.

Think of it as a way to wrap your Flask/Django/Streamlit web apps into a desktop app without needing Electron or heavy frameworks.

✨ Key Features
Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.

Uses native system webview (Edge/Chromium on Windows, WebKit on macOS/Linux).

Supports two-way communication between Python and JavaScript.

Very lightweight compared to Electron.

2. Installing PyWebView
Make sure you have Python installed, then install:

bash
pip install pywebview flask
3. Example Flask app.py
Here’s a simple Flask app you might want to run:

python
# app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "<h1>Hello from Flask inside PyWebView!</h1>"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
4. Running Flask with PyWebView
You need a launcher script that:

Starts the Flask server.

Opens a PyWebView window pointing to the local server.

python
# run.py
import threading
import webview
from app import app

def start_flask():
    app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=5000, debug=False)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run Flask in a separate thread
    t = threading.Thread(target=start_flask)
    t.daemon = True
    t.start()

    # Open PyWebView window pointing to Flask app
    webview.create_window("My Flask App", "http://127.0.0.1:5000")
    webview.start()
5. Running the Application
Save your Flask app as app.py.

Save the launcher script as run.py.

Run:

bash
python run.py
A desktop window will open showing your Flask app. 🎉

6. Notes & Tips
Debugging: Keep debug=False in Flask when embedding in PyWebView to avoid multiple reload threads.

Port: Ensure Flask runs on a fixed port (e.g., 5000) so PyWebView can connect.

Packaging: You can later package your app with PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to distribute it as a standalone desktop app.

7. Example Project Structure
程式碼
my_flask_pywebview_app/
│
├── app.py        # Flask app
├── run.py        # PyWebView launcher
└── requirements.txt
✅ With this setup, you can run any Flask-based app locally inside a native desktop window using PyWebView.

Would you like me to also show you how to package this into a standalone executable (.exe/.app) so you can share it without requiring Python?
